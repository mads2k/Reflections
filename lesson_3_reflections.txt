Reflection 3.1:
Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I would propose that its always an advantage to use a remote repository, the reason beeing that you can collaborate with others and/or you can be certain you always have a reasonably
updated backup awailable online should things turn to shit locally.

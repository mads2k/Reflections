Reflection 3.1:
Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I would propose that its always an advantage to use a remote repository, the reason beeing that you can collaborate with others and/or you can be certain you always have a reasonably
updated backup awailable online should things turn to shit locally.

Reflection 3.2:
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: I want full control over which parts of my work goes online, there is no point in updating automatically as it would be desruptive for other developers who cooperates on the same file(s).

-need the correct files and so on,
-This i am not quite sure of, i do not quite understand the concept of the staging area
-Staging area lets you commit several files at the same time, making it easier to commit several files with a logical connection.

Now i have used the tools learned to commit changes and so on. I love the staging area!! I can use it to add files according to there logical connections and commit them seperatly or together (if there is a logical connection that is!)
